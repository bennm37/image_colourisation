# Case Study in Scientific Computing

## Working Updates

### GUI
- `prettyMain.py` seems to be largely functional as of 31-01, missing full functionality in the randomised pixel function. Will update if this changes.
- `prettyMain.py` needs to be ran from within the /gui/ folder at the moment ~~and will only work on linux or mac unless the file paths within the script are changed to windows format.~~ UPDATE 30-01: should work on windows, need to test.
