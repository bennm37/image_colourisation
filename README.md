# Case Study in Scientific Computing

## Working Updates

### GUI
- `main.py` seems to be largely functional as of 02-01.
- `main.py` needs to be ran from within the /gui/ folder at the moment ~~and will only work on linux or mac unless the file paths within the script are changed to windows format.~~ UPDATE 30-01: should work on windows, need to test.
