# Case Study in Scientific Computing

## Working Updates

### GUI
- `main.py` seems to be largely functional as of 02-01.
- `main.py` needs to be ran from within the /gui/ folder at the moment ~~and will only work on linux or mac unless the file paths within the script are changed to windows format.~~ UPDATE 30-01: should work on windows, need to test. 

### Optimisation
Going to work on narrowing this down but so far we have:
- delta = 0.0200503376714422,
- sigma_1 = 96
- sigma_2 = 87.09553004603107,
- rho = 0.5644138192495579.

### Images
Within `trainingImages` there are 4 subdirectories:
1. 256px square cartoon images
1. 256px square 'real life' images
1. 512px square cartoon images
1. 512px square 'real life' images
